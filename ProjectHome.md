## DynaDroid ##

**Features:**
  * Code by convention and all your xml layouts and menus are dynamically available.
  * Screen management for pushing, popping, and swapping screens (all with transition animations).
  * Screen orientation (landscape, portrait) can be controlled on a screen by screen basis.
  * Built-in screen analytics for tracking user interaction
  * Error reporting support built-in, so if your app crashes a report is sent to you.
  * Entire framework is housed within a singe Activity, so sharing data between screens is finally easy again.

**Coming soon:**
  * More dynamic coding conventions - let's get rid of all those if/else and case statements!
  * Simplified device to server communication with xml/json parsing and automatic error handling
  * Extensions to Android UI components without all the plumbing
  * Easier to use api for interacting with device capabilities (camera, gps, phone, etc..)

## Getting Started ##

The easiest way to get started is by checking out the DynaDroid source from the subversion repository.  The source is setup as an example Android application, so all you have to do is import it into Eclipse or IntelliJ as a new project and then just run it!  And don't worry more documentation is coming soon :)
